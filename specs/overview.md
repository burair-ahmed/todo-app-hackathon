# System Overview: Horizon Todo

Horizon Todo is a high-performance, full-stack Task Management application designed with a premium, glassmorphic aesthetic.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic for migrations.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based session management.

## Key Goals
1.  **Speed**: Minimal latency in task creation and retrieval.
2.  **Design**: Premium "Horizon" mesh aesthetic.
3.  **Organization**: Multi-layered categorization (Priority, Labels, Tags).
4.  **Security**: Strict user-scoped data isolation.
